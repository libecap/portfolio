      <h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
      <p class="light">I am interested in many aspects of graphic design including print/packaging, motion, and illustration. Figuring out the best method of visual communication for the job is very rewarding. And I especially enjoy the process of turning ideas into finished products.</p>
      <p class="light push-0">Before entering graphic design, I worked fighting forest fires as a smokejumper. I have found a common similarity that both share is the need to find creative solutions with limited time and resources.</p>
