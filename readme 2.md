Christopher (a.k.a. Cap) Libecap is a graphic designer based out in Ottawa.

In a life before graphic design, I worked fighting forest fires. It is not glamorous as photos portray it. It's often long, exhausting hours. Humor and imagination helped make the days less tiring. One night at the end of a particularly long shift, I gave my tool a name and painted it on the axe head. Other crew members saw it and got excited. They asked if I could paint an idea of theirs on their tool as well. It was a great feeling to see how helping someone express themselves, could give them a boost and get them excited.

I entered graphic design to learn the principles and techniques necessary for strong and unique visual communication. We have all had it happen where we had an idea stuck in our head that we just can't figure how to "put in on paper." Graphic design is a great tool that helps find solutions on how we can best express that idea to others.

Imagination is an ember that never burns out. I believe everyone's imagination should have the chance to come to life.
