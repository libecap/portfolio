    <p class="island push-0">This is a logo rebrand study I did at Algonquin College. The purpose of the assignment was to go through all the steps of creating a logo for a company.</p>

    <h2 class="zetta push-0">Research</h2>
    <p class="island push-0">A logo should aim to be a reflection of a business' passion and cater to their target audience. Before even starting to sketch designs, I needed to learn the core principles of Planet of Sound, the personailty of their customers and who their competitors are. In order to do this, I completed a brand audit, looking into the tone and voice of the business, customer demographics and pyschographics, as well as location of the business and the location of its competitors.</p>

I also explored different styles such as abstract logo design. Music plays a big role in many people’s daily life.  It can get people excited. It can help people relax, focus, day dream, even help their plants grow according to some studies. I wanted the design of the logo to try and capture the dynamic nature of music while also looking professional and high end to reflect the quality of the products sold at Planet of Sound.</p>

    <p>Music acts like an amplipher of someone’s mood. It can get people excited. It can help people relax, focus, day dream, even help your plants grow according to some studies.
