    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This is a logo rebrand study I did at Algonquin College. The purpose of the assignment was to go through all the steps of creating a logo for a company.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>A logo should aim to be a reflection of a business' passion and cater to their target audience. Before even starting to sketch designs, I needed to learn the core principles of Planet of Sound, the personailty of their customers and who their competitors are. In order to do this, I completed a brand audit, looking into the tone and voice of the business, customer demographics and pyschographics, as well as location of the business and the location of its competitors.</p>

    <h2>Sketches</h2>
    <p>Music acts like an amplipher of someone’s mood. It can get people excited. It can help people relax, focus, day dream, even help your plants grow according to some studies. Music is pretty influencial and plays a large role in most people’s daily life. I wanted to design a logo, that conveyed that feeling while also looking professional and high end to reflect the quality of the products sold at Planet of Sound</p>

        <p>This is the primary logo to be used as the new identity for Planet of Sound. It has been designed to stand out from the competition, while conveying an elegant and dynamic feel to match the high quality audio equipment sold at Planet of Sound. Logo principles, approved variations and proper application have been included in this manual in order to maintain a consistent look for the company.</p>

        <p>Since the company needs to communicate on a variety of media sources (i.e. print, web, social media) the logo needs to have some adaptability in order to provide the highest level of visual communication. Variations of the logo have been throughly explored, giving the company flexibility with the logo while maintaining a strong consistent look regardless of where the logo is used.</p>

        <p>Clear space is the amount of space between the logo and other content/elements. The “o” in the word “of” is used to set the minimum amount of clear space. Using the “o” allows the company to determine the right amount of clear space at different sizes, while still maintaining proximity and continuity to other elements.</p>

        <p>The Planet of Sound logo cannot be reduced below 1.5 inches for print or 115px for web without affecting its readability and recognizability. For favicons or social media icons, the logo without the text cannot be reduced below .44 inches or 32px.</p>

      <div class="unit unit-xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-2-3 island text text-left">
        <p>Only use the Planet of Sound colour green as an accent. When used as the primary colour, it overpowers the type and the logo. If using the logo on a colourful background, say for packaging, use the inverted logo or the black and white logo. This will create enough contrast for the logo to continue to stand out and be identifiable.</p>

      <div class="unit unit-xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-2-3 island text text-left">
        <p>  The goal of the logo is to provide a consistent and reliable beacon for the company’s target audience to find throughout various medias (print, web, advertisement, social media). By altering the logo without a purpose it weakens the logo’s ability to stand out as a recognizable and reliable identity. Above are some examples of unacceptable deviations to the logo.</p>

        <p>  Neue Kabel is the only typeface used with the two weights being bold and regular. The company’s name is split into two different font sizes, using a scale of 2:1 (“Sound” will always be twice the font size of “Planet of”). Bold is used for “Planet of” and regular is used for “Sound” to unite the text and give it a structured and unified look while feeling dynamic.</p>
