    <h2 class="zetta push-0 pad-t">Research</h2>
    <p class="pad-t-1-2 pad-b-1-2 push-0">A logo should aim to be a reflection of a business' passion and cater to their target audience. Before even starting to sketch designs, I needed to learn the core principles of Planet of Sound, the personailty of their customers and who their competitors are. In order to do this, I completed a brand audit, looking into the tone and voice of the business, customer demographics and pyschographics, as well as location of the business and the location of its competitors.</p>

            <p class="push-0">Throughout the sketching phase I explored a variety of concepts, such as planets, audio equipment, and sound frequencies. I also explored different styles such as abstract logo design. Music plays a big role in many people’s daily life.  It can get people excited. It can help people relax, focus, day dream, even help their plants grow according to some studies. I wanted the design of the logo to try and capture the dynamic nature of music while also looking professional and high end to reflect the quality of the products sold at Planet of Sound.</p>

    <p>Music acts like an amplipher of someone’s mood. It can get people excited. It can help people relax, focus, day dream, even help your plants grow according to some studies. Music is pretty influencial and plays a large role in most people’s daily life. I wanted to design a logo, that conveyed that feeling while also looking professional and high end to reflect the quality of the products sold at Planet of Sound</p> -->
