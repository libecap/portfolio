    <h2 class="zetta">Scope</h2>
    <p class="gutter">This is a package design I did at Algonquin College. The purpose of the assignment was to find creative ways to reduce the amount of plastic used in packaging, without compromising the product inside or turning off potential customers.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="wrapper gutter">

    <h2 class="zetta">Research</h2>
    <p class="gutter">For this project, I chose to redesign Starbuck's Bistro Box. The Bistro Box is a very popular item sold at Starbucks which is made entirely out of plastic. This is for three main reasons:</p>
      <ul class="gutter push-0 list-group">
        <li class="milli gutter">The customers need to see the food</li>
        <li class="milli gutter pad-t-1-2 pad-b-1-2">The box needs to be recloseable</li>
        <li class="milli gutter">The box needs to be durable to withstand traveling to destinations</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="island">When designing a new package, my concept needed to fulfill these requirements as well, with the least amount of plastic as well. Before sketching, I needed to understand Starbucks better as well as their typical customer.</p>
          <h3 class="text-left">Starbucks Image and Values</h3>
          <p class="gutter">Starbucks is an iconic brand recognized all over the world. They started as a small coffee shop on Pike Street in Seattle, Washington growing into what it is today. They can be found in airports, colleges, and in most cities and towns.</p>
          <p class="gutter">Style and image is very important to Starbucks. Everything from the experience in their coffee shops to the packaging of the products they sell. It’s so important that they created a higher end store called Starbucks Reserve. This research tells us that there is a market opportunity at Starbucks for a more environmentally friendly package. Both financially and socially.</p>
          <p class="gutter">Starbucks is a socially conscience company that is willing to incrue higher costs in order to maintain their core values. A couple examples are:
          <ul class="gutter list-group">
            <li class="milli gutter pad-b-1-2">One of the first large companies to get LEED environmental certifications.</li>
            <li class="milli gutter">Willing to close serveral stores to retrain their employees in order to maintain core values.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="gutter">One of Starbucks' goals to be more socially and evironmentally friendly. It is aware of the amount of plastic is uses and actively looks for ways to reduce the amount where it is possible. One way Starbucks is currently doing this is by eliminating straws from their stores. Another possible way they could reduce their use of plastic would be to consider redesigning the Bistro Box.</p>
          <h3 class="push-0 text-left max-length">Current Bistro Box</h3>
        <div>
          {% pattern sections/image-text-inline title="subheader" details="This is the current Bistro Box. It does it's job well, but uses 742 cm2 of
      plastic for 157 grams of food. To put that in perspective, Ottawa has over 30 Starbucks. If each one just sold one bistro box a day, that would be 22,260 cm2 (or 24 ft2) of
      plastic being thrown away." image="/images/bistro-box.jpg" %}

          <h2 class="zetta">Outcome</h2>
          <div class="grid grid-middle">
            <div class="unit-content-center unit unit-xs-1-2 s-1-2 m-1-4 l-1-4">

            </div>
            <div class="unit-content-center unit unit-xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">
              <p class="gutter">The concept I came up with was a pyramid shaped package. It has an outer container that unfolds into a box tray, allowing the package to be opened and closed. The inner package has food dividers to keep food seperate as well as give the package a more durable design.</p>
              <p class="gutter">It eliminates almost all the plastic used in the current bistro box. It has a plastic window on the outer box to allow customers to see the food quality inside. The package would be made of FBB (folding box board) paperboard. FBB paperboard is an industry standard when it comes to packaging food for its versatility, durability and recyclability.</p>
              <p class="gutter">By printing with vegetable inks, Starbucks can further push the sustainability of the new bistro box.</p>
              <h3>Strengths of this Design</h3>
              <p class="gutter">The design is closer to following Starbucks' design and image asthetics. It can be creatively displayed both vertically and horizontally at starbucks stores. The outer container provides an opportunity for custom designs such as seasonal, specific foods, or special events.</p>
              <p class="gutter">Although the cost of producing this concept box would be more expansive than the cheaper plastic box, these costs could be offset by the marketability of advertising a newer more sustainable bistro box which falls in line with their sustainability efforts.</p>

I also explored different styles such as abstract logo design. Music plays a big role in many people’s daily life.  It can get people excited. It can help people relax, focus, day dream, even help their plants grow according to some studies. I wanted the design of the logo to try and capture the dynamic nature of music while also looking professional and high end to reflect the quality of the products sold at Planet of Sound.</p>
