  <h2 class="zetta">Scope</h2>
  <p>This is a package design I did at Algonquin College. The purpose of the assignment was to find creative ways to reduce the amount of plastic used in packaging, without compromising the product inside or turning off potential customers.</p>

  <h2 class="zetta">Research</h2>
  <p class="push-0">For this project, I chose to redesign Starbuck's Bistro Box. The Bistro Box is a very popular item sold at Starbucks which is made entirely out of plastic. This is for three main reasons:</p>
  <ul class="gutter-1-2 push-0 pad-t-3-4 list-group">
    <li class="milli" style="line-height: 1.3">The customers need to see the food.</li>
    <li class="milli pad-t pad-b" style="line-height: 1.3">The box needs to be recloseable.</li>
    <li class="milli pad-b-3-4" style="line-height: 1.3">The box needs to be durable to withstand traveling to destinations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When designing a new package, my concept needed to fulfill these requirements as well, but with significantly less plastic. Before sketching, I needed to better understand Starbucks and their typical customer.</p>
  <h3 class="text-left giga push-0 pad-b-1-2">Starbucks Image</h3>
  <p>Starbucks is an iconic brand recognized all over the world. They started as a small coffee shop on Pike Street in Seattle, Washington growing into what it is today. They can be found in airports, colleges, and in most cities and towns.</p>
  <p>Style and image is very important to Starbucks. Everything from the experience in their coffee shops to the packaging of the products they sell. It’s so important that they created a higher end store called Starbucks Reserve. This research tells us that there is a market opportunity at Starbucks for a more environmentally friendly package. Both financially and socially.</p>
  <p class="push-0">Starbucks is a socially conscience company that is willing to incrue higher costs in order to maintain their core values. A couple examples are:
    <ul class="gutter-1-2 pad-t-3-4 push-0 list-group">
      <li class="milli pad-b" style="line-height: 1.3">One of the first large companies to get LEED environmental certifications.</li>
      <li class="milli pad-b-3-4" style="line-height: 1.3">Willing to close serveral stores to retrain their employees in order to maintain core values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One of Starbucks' goals to be more socially and evironmentally friendly. They are aware of the amount of plastic they uses and are actively looking for new ways to reduce the amount when possible. One way Starbucks is currently doing this is by eliminating straws from their stores. Another possible way they could reduce their use of plastic would be to consider redesigning the Bistro Box.</p>

          <p class="push-0">During the sketching phase I was looking for a design that could be durable while interesting and unique. I started by drawing plastic containers to get an idea of the shape needed to hold food in place. From there I explored if I could create that shape using only paper. Initially I found inspiration from the Russian Matryoshka doll which has smaller dolls inside of it. I liked this style for its ability to contain smaller objects while having unique designs on the outside of the container. From here I explored stacking potential, how it would be handled, and how it could look on display. Ultimately I came to  my final design: a durable, recloseable, and more sustainable package.</p>

        <div class="unit-content-center pad-t unit unit-xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">
          <p>The concept I came up with was a pyramid shaped package. It has an outer container that unfolds into a box tray, allowing the package to be opened and closed. The inner package has food dividers to keep food seperate as well as give the package a more durable design.</p>
          <p>It eliminates almost all the plastic used in the current bistro box. It has a plastic window on the outer box to allow customers to see the food quality inside. The package would be made of FBB (folding box board) paperboard. FBB paperboard is an industry standard when it comes to packaging food for its versatility, durability and recyclability. By printing with vegetable inks, Starbucks can further push the sustainability of the new bistro box.</p>
          <h3 class="giga push-0 pad-b-1-2">Strengths Of The Design</h3>
          <p>The design is closer to following Starbucks' design and image asthetics. It can be creatively displayed both vertically and horizontally at starbucks stores. The outer container provides an opportunity for custom designs such as seasonal, specific foods, or special events.</p>
          <p>Although the cost of producing this concept box would be more expensive than the cheaper plastic box, these costs could be offset by the marketability of advertising a newer more sustainable bistro box which falls in line with their sustainability efforts.</p>
