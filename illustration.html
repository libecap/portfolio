       {% pattern sections/project-brief title="Isometric" details="I used both photoshop and illustrator to give this isometric illustration a more organic feel. This illustration could be used as a style frame for 3D modeling. An interesting application could be an AR music festival poster campaign, where a looping animation of the clouds moving past the mountain would play when viewed through an AR device." mock-up="/images/street-isometric.jpg" image="/images/isometric.jpg"  aria-details="isometric" alt-text="isometric illustration of a lone mountain peaking through the clouds. On the mountain is a long flight of stairs going to the top of the mountain. At the very top is a stage for Led Zepplin's Stairway to Heaven" %}

      {% pattern sections/project-brief title="Glue Magazine" details="The school magazine, Glue was looking for an illustration that would be a creative take on staying up late working on assignments. I explored concepts and themes of what it means to stay up late. The big takeaway was, its dark, coffee, and short on time. I took the foam-dome concept and gave it a new meaning. Here the student doesn’t even have time to break for a sip of coffee, so they use the foam dome as a tool for helping get their work done on time." mock-up="/images/glue.jpeg" image="/images/glue-sketch.png"  aria-details="glue-sketch" alt-text="illustration of a student staying up late working on an assignment on the computer in the dark while drinking coffee from a straw thats attached to a helmet that holds cups of coffee" %}

      {% pattern sections/project-brief title="Smokejumpers T-shirt" details="This illustration was for the North Cascades Smokejumpers where I previously worked. They wanted a design that gave off a “badass but not aggressive” attitude. Understanding the personality of the target audience was key. They share a similar personality to the skateboarding community: passionate, strong bonds, but like to do things a bit against the grain." mock-up="/images/jumper-tee.jpg" image="/images/smkjmp.jpg"  aria-details="smkjmp" alt-text="An illustration of a skeleton wearing a smokejumper jumpsuit staring off into the distance. Behind the skeleton is are two smokejumpers parachuting from the sky with a mountain range in the background" %}

The illustration is of a skull of a bull cow. There is an egg plant, cowboy hat and drapped fabric in the background" %}
