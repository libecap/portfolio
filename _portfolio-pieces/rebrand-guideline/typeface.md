description: |
  Neue Kabel is the only typeface used with the two weights being bold and regular. The company’s name is split into two different font sizes, using a scale of 2:1 (“Sound” will always be twice the font size of “Planet of”). Bold is used for “Planet of” and regular is used for “Sound” to unite the text and give it a structured and unified look while feeling dynamic.
