name: "Colours"
description: |
  Only use the Planet of Sound colour green as an accent. When used as the primary colour, it overpowers the type and the logo. If using the logo on a colourful background, say for packaging, use the inverted logo or the black and white logo. This will create enough contrast for the logo to continue to stand out and be identifiable.
