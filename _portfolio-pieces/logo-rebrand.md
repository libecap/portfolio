logo-title: "Logo Rebrand Study"
identity: "Preferred identity"
id-desc: |
  This is the primary logo to be used as the new identity for Planet of Sound. It has been designed to stand out from the competition, while conveying an elegant and dynamic feel to match the high quality audio equipment sold at Planet of Sound. Logo principles, approved variations and proper application have been included in this manual in order to maintain a consistent look for the company.
specs: "Logo Specifications"
specs-desc: |
  Since the company needs to communicate on a variety of media sources (i.e. print, web, social media) the logo needs to have some adaptability in order to provide the highest level of visual communication. Variations of the logo have been throughly explored, giving the company flexibility with the logo while maintaining a strong consistent look regardless of where the logo is used.
clear-space: "Clear Space"
space-desc: |
  Clear space is the amount of space between the logo and other content/elements. The “o” in the word “of” is used to set the minimum amount of clear space. Using the “o” allows the company to determine the right amount of clear space at different sizes, while still maintaining proximity and continuity to other elements.
min-size: "Minimum Size"
size-desc: |
  The Planet of Sound logo cannot be reduced below 1.5 inches for print or 115px for web without affecting its readability and recognizability. For favicons or social media icons, the logo without the text cannot be reduced below .44 inches or 32px.
colours: "Colours"
colour-desc: |
  Only use the Planet of Sound colour green as an accent. When used as the primary colour, it overpowers the type and the logo. If using the logo on a colourful background, say for packaging, use the inverted logo or the black and white logo. This will create enough contrast for the logo to continue to stand out and be identifiable.
deviations: "Avoid Identity Deviations"
deviations-desc: |
  The goal of the logo is to provide a consistent and reliable beacon for the company’s target audience to find throughout various medias (print, web, advertisement, social media). By altering the logo without a purpose it weakens the logo’s ability to stand out as a recognizable and reliable identity. Above are some examples of unacceptable deviations to the logo.
typeface: "Typefaces"
typeface-desc: |
  Neue Kabel is the only typeface used with the two weights being bold and regular. The company’s name is split into two different font sizes, using a scale of 2:1 (“Sound” will always be twice the font size of “Planet of”). Bold is used for “Planet of” and regular is used for “Sound” to unite the text and give it a structured and unified look while feeling dynamic.
