  <h2 class="zetta push-0 pad-t">Scope</h2>
  <p class="pad-t-1-2 pad-b-1-2 push-0">The goal and purpose of this project was to learn the fundamentals pf 3d modeling in order to expand my skillset and make me a more marketable graphic designer. For this project I used the package design project I had designed earlier. By creating a 3D model and animation of the package design, this would allow me to showcase the design online to a greater audience who wouldn’t normally be able to physically hold the design (i.e. via social media or portfolio website :) ). This allows me to give the package design a tactile feel digitally.</p>

  <h2 class="zetta push-0 pad-t">Research</h2>
  <p class="pad-t-1-2 pad-b-1-2 push-0">The 3d software I used is called Blender. It is a free software with powerful rendering capabilities and a variety of functions. It has a reputation for being difficult to learn but with the help of its resource guide and online tutorials I was able to take the diecut of my package design and make into an animated 3d model.</p>

For odd shapes UV wrapping is used to flatten the 3d object and make it easier to texture paint. In order to enhance the look created by the texture painting I used material adjustments to give each asset a more photo-realistic look.</p>
