  <p>At the end of my final year as a graphic design student, I completed a six week student placement at the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA). I worked on several projects and the CPA was kind enough to let me share some of them.</p>

        <p class="push-0">The CPA Student Research Magazine is a collection of student research reports from all across Canada. While their research papers had to follow certain citation methods, I was able to design the cover page, intro and table of contents page, and the back page of the magazine. It was important that the design carry though the seperate pages in order to maintain a cohesive look.  My goal was to create a professional and abstract design that would reflect the students' hardwork and the, at times, abstact nature of pyschology.</p>

      <p class="push pad-t">The CPA provides free factsheets which provide important information covering a vast library of pyschology topics. The factsheets can be found online at the CPA's website but they can also be found at clinics and counselling centers. So the design for the factsheets had to be professional but also appealing. The content varies from factsheet to factsheet so the design had to take that into consideration. Lastly, new factsheets are made and older factsheets are updated so I needed to recreate the design as a template so that in the future pychologists could write in the factsheet without worrying about effecting the layout. </p>
