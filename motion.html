My goal was to have the lower thirds be memorable as well as provide information on what was coming up next. Using transitions allowed me to create an interesting look for the lower thirds and have it flow directly into the video preview. In order to switch to the next lower third, I created several vertical bars and used alpha mattes to make it look as if the previous video was wiping away to reveal new content." image="/images/broadcast.jpg" aria-details="broadcast" alt-text="style frame of motion piece showing mountains and the title Roamin television" %}
