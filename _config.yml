  layouts:
    default: |
      The default layout should be used for almost every page, it includes the website's primary header & footer.
  colors:
    background: "--color-background"
    accent: "--color-primary"
    patterns:
      brand.logos: "--color-secondary"
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      Kepler extended is used because it has a heavier weight and slightly more spacing between the characters, making it a good typeface to use on a dark background.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary colour is white. This is so there is high contrast with the text and background colour.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colour is a kind of turquoise just to be used occasionally for accents
    colors.additional: |
      These colours are used to aid and enhance the primary and secondary colours.
